# Bootstrap-Portfolio
## Overview
In this homework part 1, I built a web design skeleton using Bootstrap. The index file was based on from HW1 which is made from HTML/CSS. There are 4 total files, index.html, contact.html, portfolio.html, and style.css. The changes are made in all except style.css from previous HW. 

## header and nav
Make a header and style it through style.css file which is linked to the index.html file. Then make a navar using bootstrap. Resources of bootstrap are from https://getbootstrap.com/

## container
Make a container that will include different boxes like card, portfolio and about me.

## about GoT
Main page of the website. It has a sub-header and an image, rows that have sub-rows and sub-columns. All were done through bootstrap. 

## contact.html
This page has everything that was written above except "about GoT" and "portfolio". Again using Bootstrap, made a contact page that asks name, an email-address and a message box. 

##portfolio.html
This pas has everything that was written above except "about GoT" and "contact". Using bootstrap, includes multiple card boxes that has an image and a paragraph underneath. 

## footer
Finish up this with making footer. Make sure to include copyrights.
