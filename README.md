# Portfolio
## Overview
In this homework, I built a web design skeleton using Bootstrap. There are 4 total files, index.html, contact.html, portfolio.html, and style.css. This portfolio is made from using the old portfolio and I have many changes to it.

## header and nav
Make a header and style it through style.css file which is linked to the index.html file. Then make a navar using bootstrap. Resources of bootstrap are from https://getbootstrap.com/

## container
Make a container that will include different boxes like card, portfolio and about me.

## main page
Main page of the website. It has a header, an image and a footer. All were done through bootstrap.

## about me
This page is for information about me. It has a row that is divided into 2 sections. Left side includes 3 pictures and right side has a paragraph. 

## contact.html
This page for users to contact me. Again using Bootstrap, made a contact page that asks name, an email-address and a comment box. 

## portfolio.html
This pas has my actual projects that I have done so far.  Using bootstrap, includes multiple card boxes that has an image and a paragraph underneath. 

## footer
Finish up this with making footer. Make sure to include copyrights.
